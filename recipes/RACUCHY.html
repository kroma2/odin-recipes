    <h3>Instrucions: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Batter</strong> – In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon (if using). <p>In another bowl, beat the eggs and then mix in the milk and vanilla extract.</p><p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Do not overmix.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Add the Apples</strong> – Gently fold the grated or finely chopped apples into the batter until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Oil</strong> – In a large skillet, heat about 1/4 inch of vegetable oil over medium heat until it shimmers.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Racuchy</strong> – Drop spoonfuls of the batter into the hot oil, flattening them slightly with the back of the spoon to form small pancakes. <p>Fry until golden brown on both sides, about 2-3 minutes per side. Adjust the heat as needed to prevent burning.</p><p>Transfer the racuchy to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong> – Serve the racuchy warm, dusted with powdered sugar if desired.</li>
